# Work In Progress

## To Do
- Start WearUnlockService once user has configured a password
- Start WearUnlockService on boot if application is enabled and a password is set
- Remove all Pebble stuff
- Remove MainActivity
- Add persistent notification (low priority) to prevent WearUnlockService from being killed.
- Improve onboarding for Android Wear
-- Select from a connected peer (could be more than one wearable peer available!)
- Launcher icon
